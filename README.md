# UFOs

## Overview
A request from a client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

When we reach the website we are than able to use the tables on the left side to do aseqrch of all data collected to narrow down searches in areas. To help compile the data into an easier to read and understand function.
With this in mind the problem we would run into is the customer would need to know exact deatils with correwct spelling and no spaces at the end.
